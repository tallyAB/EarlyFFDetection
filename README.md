# EarlyFFDetection

Project Paper: [Early Warning System for Forest Fires](https://fuchsia-trista-8.tiiny.site)

Dataset: [Fire Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10hAIYH9TE9Vvt2EVEdxqg144zhGFqf8x?usp=share_link)

Instructions for running the model:

The jupyter notebook is self contained and contains all the code needed to run the model. 

If running on colab, upload the unzipped dataset with the name "FireVsNonFire" in the main directory of gdrive. 

If running on a local machine, you will need to comment out cell#2 and alter cell#5. Unzip the dataset in the directory containing the jupyter notebook. In cell#5, change the imgs_path variable to "FireVsNonFire/". Change the "/" in lines 29 and 35 of cell#5 with "\\".
